# timelib
The program outputs the day of the year. A date must be entered for this.
If the return value is -1, then the date is invalid. The date must be between 01/01/1582 and 12/31/2400.
You can use the function input_date("struct date x") to read in a date or you can put a "struct date x" 
directly into the function "day_of_the_year(x)".
